# Assignment 2: Recursion Redesign

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone this repository

```bash
git clone <REPO_URL>
cd recursion-assignment
```

### 2. Generate the test data

Run the file system generator to create test cases and breach data:

```bash
python file_system_generator.py
```

This will create:
- `test_cases/` - Small test cases with known correct answers
- `breach_data/` - Larger compromised file system with three departments (Finance, HR, Sales)

### 3. Complete the assignment

Open `starter_code.py` and work through the parts in order by uncommenting test code as you complete each function.

## What to Submit

Submit two files:
1. **Your completed Python file** (`starter_code.py` or rename to `recursion_analysis.py`)
2. **Written analysis document** (Google Doc or Word) containing:
   - Complexity Analysis section (200-250 words)
   - Reflection section (200-300 words)
   - Total: 400-550 words
